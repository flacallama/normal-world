GRANTED, THIS IS AN ABSURD CONCEPT...
... but we live in absurd times.

The purpose of this app is to demonstrate the nature of normal distributions
in statistical models. You know, the "bell curve?. Remember?

Now imagine that normally distributed human traits could be directly compared
against one another based on their placement in that curve (aka the z-score).

That's what this app does. Ask yourself the question, if I were as smart as I 
am tall, what would my IQ be? That's exactly what normal-world is here to tell us.

As a special treat, I've included a non-normal distribution (income distribution) 
to add extra interest for the user.
